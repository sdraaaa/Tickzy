# Event Approval Workflow System

## Overview

The Event Approval Workflow System provides comprehensive control over event visibility based on admin approval status with real-time updates across all components. This system ensures that only approved events are visible to the public while providing proper management interfaces for hosts and admins.

## üéØ Core Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Event Status Management
- **Default Status**: All newly created events have `status: "pending"`
- **Status Values**: `"pending" | "approved" | "rejected" | "cancelled"`
- **Status Control**: Only admins can change event status; hosts cannot modify this field
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes reflect immediately across all dashboards

### ‚úÖ Real-Time Event Synchronization
All event fetching has been converted to use real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`):
- **Landing Page**: Shows only approved events with real-time updates
- **User Dashboard**: Real-time approved events for booking/viewing
- **Host Dashboard**: Real-time all host events with status indicators
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time all events with dedicated approval interface

### ‚úÖ Event Visibility Rules

#### Public Areas (Landing Page, Event Browsing)
- **Filter**: Only events where `status === "approved"`
- **Implementation**: Firestore queries with `where('status', '==', 'approved')`
- **Real-time**: Instant updates when events are approved/rejected

#### User Dashboard
- **Filter**: Only approved events for booking/viewing
- **Implementation**: Uses `subscribeToPopularEvents` with approval filter
- **Real-time**: Events appear/disappear instantly when status changes

#### Host Dashboard
- **Filter**: ALL of the host's own events regardless of status
- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges for "Pending Approval", "Approved", "Rejected", "Cancelled"
- **Real-time**: Instant feedback when events are approved/rejected
- **Pending Alert**: Shows notification when events are pending approval

#### Admin Dashboard
- **Filter**: ALL events with status filtering options
- **Dedicated Section**: "Event Approvals" tab with pending events queue
- **Bulk Operations**: Approve/reject multiple events at once
- **Real-time**: Instant updates when events are created or status changes

## üîê Security Implementation

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Enhanced rules prevent hosts from modifying status field
allow update: if isAuthenticated() && 
  ((resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid && 
    // Hosts cannot change status-related fields
    (!request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasAny([
      'status', 'statusUpdatedAt', 'statusUpdatedBy', 
      'approvalReason', 'rejectionReason', 'cancellationReason'
    ]))) ||
   isAdmin());

// Separate rule for admin-only status updates
allow update: if isAdmin() && 
  request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly([
    'status', 'statusUpdatedAt', 'statusUpdatedBy', 
    'approvalReason', 'rejectionReason', 'cancellationReason'
  ]);
```

### Permission Enforcement
- **Create Events**: Only approved hosts can create events (status auto-set to 'pending')
- **Approve/Reject**: Only admins can change event status
- **View Events**: Public sees approved only, hosts see all their own, admins see all

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Services Enhanced

#### `src/services/eventsService.ts`
- **subscribeToEvents()**: Filters for approved events only (public)
- **subscribeToAllEvents()**: Shows all events (admin only)
- **subscribeToPendingEvents()**: Shows pending events (admin only)
- **subscribeToHostEvents()**: Shows all host events (host-specific)
- **updateEventStatus()**: Admin-only status updates

#### `src/services/adminService.ts` (New)
- **approveEvent()**: Approve event with optional reason
- **rejectEvent()**: Reject event with optional reason
- **cancelEvent()**: Cancel event (admin or host)
- **bulkApproveEvents()**: Approve multiple events
- **bulkRejectEvents()**: Reject multiple events
- **subscribeToEventApprovalStats()**: Real-time approval statistics

### Components Updated

#### AdminDashboard.tsx
- **New Tab**: "Event Approvals" with pending events queue
- **Bulk Operations**: Select and approve/reject multiple events
- **Real-time Stats**: Live approval statistics
- **Action Buttons**: Individual approve/reject with confirmation

#### HostDashboard.tsx
- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges and icons for each status
- **Pending Alert**: Notification when events need approval
- **Real-time Updates**: Events update instantly when approved/rejected
- **Status-based Actions**: Edit only available for pending events

#### LandingPage.tsx & UserDashboard.tsx
- **Approved Only**: Automatically filter for approved events
- **Real-time Updates**: New approved events appear instantly

## üìä Database Queries & Indexing

### Query Patterns
```javascript
// Public areas - approved events only
where('status', '==', 'approved')

// Admin approval queue - pending events only
where('status', '==', 'pending')

// Host events - all events by specific host
where('createdBy', '==', hostId)

// Admin view - all events (no filter)
```

### Required Firestore Indexes
1. **Events by Status**: `status` (ascending) + `createdAt` (descending)
2. **Events by Host**: `createdBy` (ascending) + `createdAt` (descending)
3. **Events by Category & Status**: `status` (ascending) + `category` (ascending) + `createdAt` (descending)

## üß™ Testing & Validation
